Hello, welcome to Alex Deaconu's assignment 1 for IMTC 505! To play my game, you can use WASD to move the cube around, and move the mouse to move the camera left and right. Press spacebar to fire lasers. 

Interactive elements:
- Something that changes position: the cube moves with WASD, and the lasers that get shot out move straight in the direction they are shot.
- Something happens when you press a key: We can move around with WASD, and also fire lasers with Spacebar.
- UI Element: I display some short instructions on the screen so that the user knows the controls.
- Something audio related: The lasers have a cool sound effect.
- Something happens when you click or do something with the mouse: We can use the mouse to control our camera left and right on the cube.
